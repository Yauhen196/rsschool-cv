        In Sempember, 2020 I quited from the Investigative Committee of the Republic of Belarus because of my civil position, after that I decided to connect my life with the IT-sphere, 
        because I want to get new skills, to know new information and to grow about myself, and I think, that in this sphere I can realize myself. <br>
